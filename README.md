# Celery Gaming
The goal here is to build a nice-looking and functional console for managing a Minecraft server. It should feature user authentication via Google Firebase, where each user can have access to multiple servers. The console will have direct access to the MC console, the files that makeup the server, the connection and server information from GCP, and more. Users will be able to add/invite other users to be a server's administrator.
